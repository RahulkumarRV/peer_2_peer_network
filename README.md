** What is an IP address **
- IP address used by each device to connect with the internet, without IP address no device can connect with the internet
- IP addresses are usually two types IPv4 and IPv6, but we are only talk about IPv4 only here
- IP looks like 203.0.113.12 and IP has four blocks of number where each is of size 1 Bytes, each block has a range from 0 to 255
- IP addresses assigned to each device usually in two ways
  1. statically (manually)
  2. Dynamically (DHCP)
